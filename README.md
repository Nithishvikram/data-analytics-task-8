# data-analytics-task-8



This project involves creating an interactive and insightful sales dashboard using Power BI or Tableau, based on a dataset containing sales transactions with columns like Order Date, Region, Category, Sales, Profit, Customer Name, and Place. The first step is to import the dataset (in CSV or Excel format) into the visualization tool. Once imported, the "Order Date" column is transformed into a "Month-Year" format to enable monthly trend analysis. The dashboard includes three key visualizations: a **Line Chart** displaying monthly sales trends, a **Bar Chart** comparing total sales across different regions, and a **Donut Chart** illustrating the sales distribution among product categories. To enhance user interactivity, a **Slicer** or **Filter** is added, allowing viewers to drill down into data by Region or Category. Conditional formatting and customized color schemes are applied to highlight top-performing regions and categories, making it easier to spot patterns and outliers. From the visual analysis, key insights can be drawnâ€”for example, identifying the month with the highest sales, recognizing the region that consistently outperforms others, and spotting the most profitable product category. Overall, the dashboard provides a clear, visually compelling summary of sales performance that supports data-driven decision-making.
